### Research, Sleep Hacking...
This repository is aimed at storing all of our research and examples of **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Pattern Matching** and more. We are working on understanding all natural sleep patterns using movement data, so we can then detect sleep disorders.

## 📁 Repository Organisation

We decided to make our research publicly available, open source research.
To maintain simplicity and our documents organized, we'll publish all our **Proof Of Concepts** and **Research Docs** in two different main folders.
