# How to run the following POC

### How to run:
Using a raw data from an actigraphy process, run the following:
- (version >3.5 it's working) `python3 algorithm.py` 
- (only version 2.7) `python algorithm.py`

### Python List package required

Package
---------------
scipy==1.6.0
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.20.0
seaborn==0.11.1
pandas==1.2.1
scikit_learn==0.24.2


## POC Description
The K-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that attempts to partition the dataset into K distinct non-overlapping
clusters with each data point belonging to a single cluster. However, as described in the drive report below, there is
an overfitting behaviour because we have limitations. Additional research would be needed.
